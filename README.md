#Deep Neural Network Visualization with Javascript

In this repository I am saving some libraries for building a Deep Neural Network in Javascript with a goal of visualizing the neuron connections (Weights). 

Here I include a copy of the Math.js (http://mathjs.org) matrix library for javascript and the libraries Y developed for visualization of the DNN.

You can see the libraries working here:
